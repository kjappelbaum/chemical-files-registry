# chemical-files-registry

_This repository is still in an exploratory phase_

The goal of this repository is to create a registry for filetypes that are commonly used in chemistry. This is important so that different codes/users know about which file formats they talk about. Also, users/developers might want to share some caveats with certain file types with the community.
